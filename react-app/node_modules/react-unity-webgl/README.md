When building content for the web, you might need to communicate with elements on a webpage. Or you might want to implement functionality using Web APIs which Unity does not currently expose by default. In both cases, you need to directly interface with the browserâ€™s JavaScript engine. React Unity WebGL provides an easy solution for embedding Unity WebGL builds in your React application, with two-way communication between your React and Unity application with advanced API's.

Hi! My name is Jeffrey Lanters, thanks for visiting! This package is an open source hobby project with ongoing development. A result of a long road and endless fight with Unity's updates since 2017, full of sleepless nights, working after hours, and busy weekends. If you're using this module for production, please consider donating to support the project. Thank you!

# Installation

Install using npm for your JavaScript or TypeScript React Project. Make sure you download the package version corresponding with your Unity version. I try to update this plugin in case of need as fast as possible. Please keep in mind that some documentation may not be accurate when using an older version of this module.

```sh
$ npm install react-unity-webgl
```

```sh
$ npm install react-unity-webgl@7.x  # For Unity 2018 and 2019 (LTS)
$ npm install react-unity-webgl@6.x  # For Unity 2017 (LTS)
$ npm install react-unity-webgl@5.x  # For Unity 5.6 (LTS)
```

# Usage

To get started import the Unity and Unity Context class from the React Unity WebGL library. Create a new context object and assign it in your render function. For further intructions please head to the [documentation](https://github.com/elraccoone/react-unity-webgl/wiki) or go straight to the [quick start guide](https://github.com/elraccoone/react-unity-webgl/wiki/Quick-Start-Guide). Have fun coding!

```jsx
import React from "react";
import Unity, { UnityContext } from "react-unity-webgl";

const unityContext = new UnityContext({
  loaderUrl: "build/myunityapp.loader.js",
  dataUrl: "build/myunityapp.data",
  frameworkUrl: "build/myunityapp.framework.js",
  codeUrl: "build/myunityapp.wasm",
});

const App = () => {
  return <Unity unityContext={unityContext} />;
};
```
